![Alt Text](https://github.com/venky4c/rest-countries-api/blob/master/dist/Countries.gif)

Key Learnings:
- Implemented using Redux and [Saga](https://github.com/venky4c/rest-countries-api/blob/master/dist/src/redux/saga.js) as middleware
- [React Route](https://github.com/venky4c/rest-countries-api/blob/master/dist/src/components/routes.js) to generate the country link dynamically when the user drills down on a particular country
- [React forms](https://github.com/venky4c/rest-countries-api/blob/master/dist/src/components/Content.js) to be able to search for a country on 'Enter' key press, without the need for a separate submit button
- [React Context](https://github.com/venky4c/rest-countries-api/blob/master/dist/src/themeContext.js) for implementing dark theme
